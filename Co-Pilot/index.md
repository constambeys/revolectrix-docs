The FMA Direct Co-Pilotâ„¢(PN CPD4) Flight Stabilization Unit (FSU) is a patented system that senses the difference in infrared signature between the earth and the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to provide 100% real time, day or night stabilization about two axes on any model. Its action may be visualized as the equivalent of a string tautly stretched between the center of the earth and deep space on which the model is constantly held so that it can not turn downward unless commanded.

Applications: Stabilize any R/C fixed wing airplane, helicopter, special configuration

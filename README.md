# Manuals and User Guides for Revolectrix

Revolectrix (FMA, Inc) is [gone](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=47671219&postcount=1). This is an unofficial mirror with documentations and users guides of their chargers and other products.

> After 36 years in business FMA, Inc has made the decision to cease business operations, effective August 31, 2021. Also ceasing operations is the brand Revolectrix.
> 
> Started in 1985 by Fred Marks, FMA has proudly served the R/C Hobby Industry for 25 of its 36 years. The pandemic brought multiple challenges to manufacturing FMA’s products in Asia as disruptions in supply chains and multiple delays and staff shortages at our contract manufacturer all contributed to the decision. As owners and officers of FMA, my brother Tim and I are reaching retirement age and looking forward to pursuing other interests.
> 
> Over the years we have made many friends in the business. We want to thank all those friends for the support and encouragement. Most of all we want to offer a special thanks to the thousands of customers who have made this family business a joy to operate. The Revolectrix and FMA websites, including both stores, REVO USA and REVO Singapore, will become inaccessible in the coming days. Phone and email service will continue until August 31.
> 
> Our longest tenured employee and friend, Howard Matos, plans to continue serving the hobby community by offering a repair service for FMA and Revolectrix products. Howard’s efforts will be unrelated to the FMA and Revolectrix business. More information will be available from Howard soon.

> This is very sad news for many people including myself as I have been with the company for over 26 years. I have held hope that we would make it through another hard time just as we have done in the past but the Covid outbreak hurt us like never before and in so many different ways.
>
> I pray for my friends and family (because after 26 years we have all become family), that our great God will lead us all to new opportunities in the very near future. With Jamie and Tim’s approval, I have decided that I will continue to do non-warranty repair work on the FMA/Revolectrix product lines. This is not affiliated with FMA or Revolectrix in any manner.

> If you have repair items, a $25 non-refundable diagnosis charge will be incurred and applied to any repair fee. Please keep in mind that your equipment may be damaged beyond repair or not cost effective to repair in which the $25 diagnosis fee is still paid. You will also be responsible for all shipping charges. I will also be selling Bump Tags, FUIM3’s, and other charger peripheral products. Please email me at: hmatosrepairs@gmail.com for any questions.
>
> I will only accept Venmo for payment at this time.

> Best,

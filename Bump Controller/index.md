BUMP is an exclusive Revolectrix concept for Battery Management.

BUMP technology utilizes Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to communicate with any battery equipped with a
BUMP Compliant Tag, or “BumpTag”.

BumpTags are pre-installed and pre-configured on most Revolectrix batteries, but are also available separately, so customers can configure them for use
with any battery of their choice. Once a BumpTag is programmed for a given battery, a simple
“BUMP” of the battery on a Revolectrix BUMP-compliant charger or controller and it is ready to
charge.

The Revolectrix PowerLab Touch chargers have BUMP support built in, and the legacy Revolectrix PowerLab series chargers can add BUMP support by connecting a BUMP Controller which takes complete control of the PowerLab chargers. BUMP technology allows you to only
configure the settings for a pack one time – when the BumpTag is configured, rather than every
time you want to charge it.
